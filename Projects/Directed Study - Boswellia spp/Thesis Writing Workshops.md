### Introductions

#### Academic prompts to create a research space
- There is evidence that X plays a crucial role in... | recently, there has been renewed interest in...
- There is currently little known about X
- This thesis aims to (occupy the niche, fill the gap) | the specific objective of this study was to investigate

Introductions and literature reviews follow a similar structure, but differ in length and focus.
- Introduction tends to focus on research signficance and provides the general background for the research questions or aims
- Lit review focuses on the overall state of the field of research, including main dieas found in the literature and knowledge gaps present in the literature that motivate the thesis work.

#### Ideas
**The knowledge gap**
- Neurotensin is a neuropeptide that ... although it is linked to disorders ... nothing is known about the relationship between NT and....

```
The mechanisms that underpin the species variation in Boswellia spp. are not fully understood.

It is well established that the genetic variation in the Boswellia genus is high not only in beta diversity, but alpha diversity. However, the influence on the chemotaxonomy of this genus has not yet been explored.

Much uncertainty still exists about the relationship between genetic variation and metabolomic variation within the Boswellia genus.
