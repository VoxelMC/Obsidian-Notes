## Previous Extraction

### Notes

- Chloroform is denser than sample, methanol is less dense. This makes sense.
- Consistent choice of samples: slightly translucent, yellow tinge, brown or orange discolorations avoided.
- 3 mL of solvent used. 
- Sonication and vortexing treatments.
- Obtained samples of similar mass.
- 

### Pros and Cons

```diff
+ Methanol and Chloroform are good starting solvents
- Low sample surface area
- Samples likely had moisture
```


## Second Extraction

### Goals

```diff
+ More replicates
+ Good solvent choices
+ Replicates of different species
- Less sample to sample variance
```

### Notes

BE VERY CLEAR!!! This will probably end up in methods.

Perhaps an erlenmeyer on a shaker platform is better suited for this extraction. More movement of the solvent. However, a volatile solvent wouldn't really work for this, so $\text{CHCl}_{3}$ is probably best. 

Should I:
- Use one piece for each treatment? Such as, cut once piece into 4 equally sized pieces, and subject to 4 different treatments?
This would account for measuring sample to sample variance.

Measuring mass before and after of remaining piece sounds like a good bet.

Consider Soxhlet extraction, though Shipley does not seem too fond of this idea.
- Has been done before on frankincense, find a paper on this.
