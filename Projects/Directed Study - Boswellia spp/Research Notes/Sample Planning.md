### Data points

Absolute low end is 3 points per species
Aim for 5, 7 would be nice. How long would each of these take?

### Samples

If we use all species, 3 samples per species, we have 27 total samples.

27 total samples run twice each, is 54 runs. Each run takes 4.5 minutes averaged between benchtop runs and 400 runs.

27 samples (54 runs) is 
- 243 minutes, ~4 hours total of spectra
- Assuming 9 extractions simultaneously, 3 hours of extraction + 3 hours of setup total
- This is 7 working hours.

5 samples per species, we have 45 total samples. 

45 samples (90 runs) is
- ~7 hours of spectra,
- 9 simultaneously is 5 hours of extraction and 5 hours of setup, making 10 hours
- This is 17 working hours. 

On Tuesday, I am on campus at noon. After class is over and I get food, it will be 2 or 2:30. 2 rounds of extractions per tuesday makes for 4 hours of extraction max and 3 hours of spectra max. That takes me to 9pm.

Thursdays, if I do the same thing, I am done by noon, takes me to 7 pm.

If i only work on Tuesdays and Thursdays, doing 2 extractions and spectra per day, I will get it done in 2 weeks.
