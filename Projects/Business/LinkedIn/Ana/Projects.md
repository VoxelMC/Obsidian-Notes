## Honours Thesis

Title: Biochemistry Honours Thesis Researcher

Description:
As a dedicated researcher in Biochemistry, my Honours Thesis delved into the intricate world of assays, discovering and identifying two genes from Rauwolfia serpentina and Camptotheca acuminata. These genes were found to be critical contributors to the production of novel monoterpene indole alkaloids, marking a significant milestone in my exploration of biochemical pathways.

Throughout this research journey, I immersed myself in the nuances of protein expression and purification techniques, gaining a profound understanding of these essential processes. The hands-on experience enriched my technical skills and provided a holistic view of the complexities involved in bioanalytical work.

In addition to my laboratory contributions, I dedicated time to enhancing my scientific writing skills. The culmination of this effort resulted in the creation of a detailed thesis and a compelling research poster. These written outputs reflected the depth of my research and showcased my ability to articulate complex scientific concepts clearly and concisely.

Undertaking this Honours Thesis in Biochemistry has been a transformative experience, combining experimental exploration with refining crucial research skills. It has expanded my knowledge base and prepared me for future endeavours where a deep understanding of biochemistry, coupled with effective communication, is paramount.
