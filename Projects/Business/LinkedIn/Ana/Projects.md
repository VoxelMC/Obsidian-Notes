Title: iGEM Project Finance Leader and Wet Lab Member

Description:
As the Finance Leader for our International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition team, I successfully secured $27,000 CAD in funding, managing a team of three to cover research, registration, and flight costs. My responsibilities included overseeing reimbursements and materials acquisition. As a Wet Lab member, I also actively participated in lab work, encompassing molecular cloning, transformation, primer and plasmid design.

Additionally, I assisted in crafting the judging presentation script and slides, ultimately presenting our results at the judging session in Paris before a panel of esteemed judges. This experience provided me with invaluable skills in teamwork, collaboration, and project management. On a technical front, I honed my lab skills, gaining proficiency in molecular biology techniques. Simultaneously, my involvement in financial aspects of the competition enhanced my expertise in finance, budgeting, and accounting.

Participating in iGEM not only offered a platform for student-led research but also served as a catalyst for multifaceted skill development, shaping me into a versatile professional capable of seamlessly blending scientific and financial acumen.

## IURA

Title: Undergraduate Research Awardee: Bioanalytical Project Contributor

Description:
As a participant in the International Undergraduate Research Award Project, I showcased my research prowess through the Undergraduate Research Awards Symposium poster exhibition. My role involved hands-on application of advanced techniques, including high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, His-tag protein purification and concentration, and DNA purification.

One of my key contributions was the design and execution of assays aimed at determining the optimal conditions for an unknown enzyme. This involved a blend of precision, innovation, and problem-solving, showcasing my commitment to advancing scientific understanding. Through this project, I gained practical experience in cutting-edge methodologies, refining my skills in bioanalytical techniques.

Participating in the International Undergraduate Research Award Project not only allowed me to present my findings to my peers but also provided a platform for refining my technical skills and fostering a deep appreciation for the intricacies of experimental design and analysis.




## Honours Thesis

Title: Biochemistry Honours Thesis Researcher

Description:
As a dedicated researcher in Biochemistry, my Honours Thesis delved into the intricate world of assays, leading to the discovery and identification of two genes from Rauwolfia serpentina and Camptotheca acuminata. These genes were found to be key contributors to the production of novel monoterpene indole alkaloids, marking a significant milestone in my exploration of biochemical pathways.

Throughout this research journey, I immersed myself in the nuances of protein expression and purification techniques, gaining a profound understanding of these essential processes. The hands-on experience not only enriched my technical skills but also provided a holistic view of the complexities involved in bioanalytical work.

In addition to my laboratory contributions, I dedicated time to enhance my scientific writing skills. The culmination of this effort resulted in the creation of a detailed thesis and a compelling research poster. These written outputs not only reflected the depth of my research but also showcased my ability to articulate complex scientific concepts in a clear and concise manner.

Undertaking this Honours Thesis in Biochemistry has been a transformative experience, combining experimental exploration with the refinement of crucial research skills. It has not only expanded my knowledge base but has also prepared me for future endeavors where a deep understanding of biochemistry, coupled with effective communication, is paramount.
