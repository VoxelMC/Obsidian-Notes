## IURA Second Iter:

Engaging in the International Undergraduate Research Award (IURA) project provided me with an opportunity for early exposure to research experience at my university. During the project, I strategically designed and executed assays to determine optimal conditions for an unknown enzyme. This endeavour underscored my dedication to advancing scientific understanding through precision, innovation, and problem-solving. 

I applied advanced techniques throughout the project, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), His-tag protein purification and concentration, and DNA purification. These hands-on experiences broadened my technical expertise and refined my skills in critical bioanalytical methodologies. 

The IURA empowered me to contribute to the scientific community. Moreover, it allowed me to present my findings at the Undergraduate Research Awards Symposium poster exhibition. This platform culminated my research, enabling me to share insights and field questions with professionals and receive valuable feedback on my project. 

~~The symposium experience further enriched my understanding of experimental design intricacies, completing a comprehensive learning cycle in this enriching research endeavour.~~

## iGEM Second Iter:

As the Finance Leader for iGEM-Okanagan's first team established on the Okanagan campus, I was pivotal in securing CAD 27,000 in funding to address the ambitious goals of the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition. iGEM aims to harness synthetic biology to tackle global issues while making impactful solutions accessible to communities worldwide. My finance leadership involved managing a team of three, ensuring coverage of research, registration, and flight costs, and overseeing reimbursements and materials acquisition. 

Simultaneously, as a dedicated Wet Lab member, I actively engaged in molecular cloning, transformation, and the intricate design of primers and plasmids. Beyond the lab, I contributed significantly to crafting the judging presentation script and slides, culminating in the presentation of our results at the judging session in Paris. This journey resulted in iGEM-Okanagan earning a Gold medal and a nomination for the best wiki award. 

This experience enriched my skill set by providing me with technical proficiency in molecular biology and invaluable teamwork, collaboration, and project management skills. The synthesis of financial management, laboratory expertise, and collaborative leadership cultivated during iGEM has shaped me into a versatile professional capable of navigating the intersection of scientific innovation and financial stewardship.

## Honours Second Iter
   
In my final year at UBC Okanagan, I had the opportunity to write an honours thesis in biochemistry, summarizing my academic journey marked by practical laboratory exploration and the refinement of scientific writing skills. This research endeavour follows my prior engagement in the International Undergraduate Research Award (IURA) project, leveraging the expertise gained to delve into experiments centred on two genes from Rauwolfia serpentina and Camptotheca acuminata. These genes encode novel alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) crucial to forming monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs). 

The primary objective of my research was to elucidate the chemical structure of new products generated by these ADHs. Throughout this investigative journey, I immersed myself in the intricacies of protein expression and purification techniques, honing my technical skills and gaining a comprehensive understanding of bioanalytical complexities. 

Beyond laboratory contributions, a significant portion of my efforts has been dedicated to practicing my scientific writing skills. As I conclude this research at the end of April, I anticipate presenting my findings as a comprehensive thesis and a poster at the Undergraduate Research Symposium at UBC-O. This experience will not only expand my knowledge base but also equip me with the essential skills to communicate my scientific activities effectively - a valuable asset for future pursuits in biochemistry.
