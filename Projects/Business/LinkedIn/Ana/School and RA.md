1. UBC:
    
- Bachelor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Medical and Molecular Biology option.
- Enrolled in the Honours program under Dr. Dang's supervision. Worked to elucidate the chemical structure of the novel alcohol dehydrogenase products.
- Helped found and participated in the first iGEM-Okanagan Team. The team went to the Grand Jamboree in Paris, France, to present our results, winning the Gold medal.
- Won International Undergraduate Research Award 2023. During the summer, worked on purifying the novel alcohol dehydrogenases from Camptotheca acuminata and Rauvolfia serpentina, as well as optimizing their conditions in the product assays.
- Completed the following courses: Molecular Genetics, Biocatalysis, Enzymology, Proteins, Natural Product Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Virology, Immunology, Biochemical Basis of Disease, Pharmacology, and Microbiology. 
- Favourite courses included Analytical Chemistry (for its explanation of complex concepts such as HPLC, chromatography, and mass spectrometry in a simple and accessible way) and Biocatalysis (for its foundational teachings on the scope and functions of the most industrially used enzymes, as well as its inspiring of possibly novel ideas)

2. Research Assistant:

- Consistently practiced valuable skills such as high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, his-tag protein purification and concentration, and DNA purification.
- Designed numerous assays to determine the optimal conditions of an unknown, novel enzyme.
- Participated in the Undergraduate Research Awards Symposium poster exhibition for the second time.
- Trained newcomers in day-to-day operations in the lab, such as culturing, protein purification, and instrument/equipment operation.
