- Navigation Bar
	- Need to finalize the icon vectors and colours for each dropdown option.
	- Also need someone to go through and finalize the descriptions of each option. Here are the parameters:
		- The maximum length of the description **CANNOT** exceed 30 characters. I have designed the navigation bar to automatically take only the first 25 characters and add a `'...'` at the end should the description text exceed that length. Here is an example:
			- Example A: `Hello World`: This text 11 characters long and will be fully displayed.
			- Example B: `This is a wonderful day to go for a walk`: This text is 40 characters long and therefore will be cut to the following: `This is a wonderful day t...`.

- Hero Header Backgrounds
	- Need someone to find good quality background images for most (if not all) hero header on different pages.
	- Currently only one image is being used repeatedly.
	- Resources to help:
		- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/bee/): A open-license website for photos. (98% sure ðŸ‘€)
		- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com): Same thing as above.
	- Important Notes:
		- Please make sure to get images with a **high resolution**. Remember these images will be stretched to cover the entire header. If they have a poor resolution, at the table or desktop screen sizes (if not earlier), they will look pixelated.
