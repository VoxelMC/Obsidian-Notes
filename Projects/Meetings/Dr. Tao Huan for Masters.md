use some algorithms and implement them in a web platform
introduce more interactivity to something like MetaboAnalyst

how do you exploratorily visualize a BIG BIG BIG bunch of data

lc-ms based metabolomics alignment can suck (misaligned features, cannot be visualized without better strategies)

Make fundamental method development to improve the performance of ms-based metabolomics, etc.

Develop a method to improve analytical performance
better sample prep
better LC-MS analysis
better data interpretation

Lots of collaborations with environmental
- exposomics
	- environmental metabolomics
		- the totality of environmental exposure
		- 10 to 20 years lagged behind metabolomics
		- How can we improve the performance of untargeted?
			- How do you confirm these unknown compounds?

UofA
- 2m collab
- Edmonton is cold -> melted water from snow goes into the river and is used in drinking water.
	- LCMS-based method and bioinformatics to detect chlorinated products

Cancer metabolomics (VGH)
- Urine tests are time-consuming and expensive.
- biomarker diagnosis

think big, not just a little step-by-step, moving forward

research-direction-based, complementary to others (learn from each other but be independent)

10 people,
One technician,
Seven grad students,
mainly PhD

2 HPLC HRMS
One lc triple-quad for targeted
One web server and one GPU server

learning opportunities

training programs
us forest service to study wood ID
International collaborations

funding enough to cover tuition

come to Vancouver for the reading week?
Come to the lab when I am in Vancouver!

His peeps get grants and jobs willy-nilly.
