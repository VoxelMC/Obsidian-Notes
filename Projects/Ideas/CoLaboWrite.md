Alternate name: ReiterWrite, IterWriter

**Live Markdown Editor**

## Description

CoLaboWrite is a live online collaborative Markdown editor. It will feature a live updating preview pane - rendered on the client - and a git blame-like provenance system. It will also feature a review mode in which comments can be made, and read-only notes.

## Notes

If called `CoLaboWrite`, each "note" will be called a `Lab` or `Laboratory`
If called `IterWriter`, each "note" will be called an `iteration`, and new ones will be created by "calling `next()`" (clicking a button labelled `next();`)
