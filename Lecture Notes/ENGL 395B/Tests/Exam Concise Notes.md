## Panentheism

If the Force is the vital energy that animates everything, if everything ultimately emerges out of the Force, then everything that happens, whether for good or evil, would seem to be attributable to the Force.

The evil is something that is, but rather the nothingness where a hand or a planet should be. Understanding evil as an absence allows us to reconcile our “one all-powerful Force” encompassing everything with the opposition between good and evil, reinterpreted as the opposition between the all-embracing Force and the gaping holes of nothingness that puncture the Force and tear open its fabric 

Known as the privation theory of evil, this view is closely associated with the Christian philosopher Augustine of Hippo (354–430).

Diminish a thing’s measure, order, and form, and you diminish its goodness. Subtract all measure, order, and form, and you’re left with nothing.

## Morality and Decisions

Most proposed answers for finding the right choices fall into one of three schools of thought: **virtue ethics** (do what a virtuous person would do), **consequentialism** (do what will bring the best outcome for all involved), and **deontology** (do your duty no matter the consequences).

_The Mandalorian_ is the story of one man's moral overhaul toward care. And, you guessed it: it's all because of the Child. But Djarin's metamorphosis is not simply him discovering his nurturing side. It involves a far deeper shift in how he views himself and his relationships. At the heart of this change lies his gradual disenchantment with moral decisions based solely on the ethics of rights and their replacement with the ethics of care.

Taken together, early Mando's moral decisions are based on hierarchy, status, rules, fairness, maximizing benefit, and values. They reflect an ethics of rights, in which logic and reasoning bring deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics into combined action.

## Existentialism

The moral dilemma Mando faces as he struggles to return the Child to the Jedi Order is illuminated by Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), one of the central figures of _existentialism_, a philosophy centred on the belief that individuals define themselves through their actions.

Kierkegaard's Christian existentialism was critical of the social dynamics and religious models that were supposed to represent authentic religiosity but were actually hypocritical and naive.

In the moment when God commands Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac as an offering, he realizes that a single individual is more important than a universal ethical system of right and wrong – what a paradox! Kierkegaard calls this the “teleological suspension of the ethical.” What does this mean?

## Perennial Journey Home

Perennial -> Long-lasting

This journey moves the individual out from **known territory** (the parochial/ the home/ego-consciousness) **to unknown territory** (often a descent into strange or terrible lands/unconsciousness) where the **individual** is sometimes **aided** (mentors/gods/shamans/ dreams), and is often sorely **tested** (demons/Shadow-self ), in a **search** for a **treasure** or **boon** (gold/grail/enlightenment/individuation) that the individual then **shares** with the **culture** upon **returning** home (cultural enlightenment/awareness of the undivided nature of being/transconsciousness).

myths are ‘‘the secret opening through which the inexhaustible energies of the cosmos pour into human cultural manifestations.’’

Living myths become the antidote to cynicism.’’

	More recently, to the extent to which contemporary cultures have been impacted by the rapid development of technology—from the Industrial Revolution onward —they have responded with a cultural myth about the relationship between technology/science and humanity/spirituality. This myth has been played out most predominantly in science fiction, from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.

## Fantasy of SW

H. Bruce Franklin writes about the state of science fiction in this decade: “Visions of the future projected in the Anglo-American SF [science fiction] films during this period have been overwhelmingly pessimistic […] many of these films openly proclaim that their dismal futures are extrapolations of tendencies perceived in present society”

Star Wars, on the other hand, stays far from any direct political involvement. As Andrew Gordon wrote in 1989, “the film does not serve a single constituency and cannot really be reduced to a single political message” (91). This is not to say that political messages cannot be extrapolated from the film’s mythic images and narrative, but merely that the film was not engaging with political issues in the same direct or polemical manner that other science fiction films of its time were

It would be inaccurate, however, to claim that Star Wars had no effect on the tradition of science fiction film. Indeed, Star Wars caused a significant shift within that genre, encouraging sensory spectacle instead of ethical questions and accessibility over extremity, resulting in films like Star Trek: The Motion Picture (Wise, 1979) and Dune (Lynch, 1984). But Star Wars itself is better considered a part of another genre: the fantasy film. As genres are not ahistorical but change and shift with time and culture, it is necessary to recognize that because Star Wars was severely out of step with the environment of the 1970s in which it was produced and with the preceding decade of science fiction films, we must look elsewhere for its generic associations.

The force is significant in this equation, as spiritual forces have played roles in the stories of long past (Beowulf, 1815) and more recent fantasies (Tolkien, Lewis). When taken in the context of the blue opening title, Grand Moff Tarkin’s (Peter Cushing) statement to Darth Vader (David Prowse and James Earl Jones) takes on another layer of meaning: “The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that’s left of their religion.”

Although the film blatantly draws upon ideas from previous works of fiction and events in history, its atmosphere and iconography have become all its own. The lightsaber is one example of this. It is Excalibur with the look of lightning: rare, deadly, bright, and effortlessly wieldy. Yet the two weapons – one from medieval lore, the other a 1976 invention – now hold almost equal and completely separate places within popular culture.

###### Preoccupation by War

The Galactic Way of Warfare

- Anti-system and Anti-war motivations
	- Focused on foregrounding the problems inherent in violence and war
- Film as the medium, Lucas intended to horrify the audience with war imagery
- Asymmetric warfare
- Many assume that the Empire in SW represents the USSR or Nazis, but McVeigh claims that the Evil Empire represents a version of America itself.

The "Long War"

From beginning of WW1 to end of Cold War. The end of this period marked a Revolution of Military Affairs

Leading up to, enduring, and after 9/11, there was an understanding that warfare has changed
There was new technology and military practice shifted.

- Shifts in institutions such as the Senate and the Jedi Order
- Droids
- Clones
