### Binary Opposition and Dualism

Interrelated

Dualisms are ideologies or belief systems that are structured on binary opposites
- Mind-body
- Good-evil

*Works under the assumption that these ideas are always separate and opposite. Always B/W, no grey, etc.*

Our reading of binary oppositions using structuralism and deconstruction to highlight contradictions and variety within these structures, challenges, etc.

#### **Binary Opposition** in the Jedi and Sith

Possibly:
- **Represented by The Force**
	-
- **Represented by The Ideology**
	- Two different Religions based on the single commonality of The Force

`Does Star Wars reaffirm or challenge dualistic thinking?`
On a movie by movie basis, it differs
- [[Episode IV - A New Hope|A New Hope]] $\rightarrow$ Mostly black and white, but it can in Obi Wan that he is previously affected.
- [[Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back|Empire Strikes Back]] $\rightarrow$ The idea that it can be bridged is introduced

As a whole in the universe, as the Force is a fundamental natural axiom, you cannot separate the belief systems into an explicitly binary opposition. Every movie is **framed** in a dualistic system, but then does some active defiance of that - maintaining that the dualism is still a greater reason for the conflict.

| The Rebellion                         | The Empire                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Ship imagery rounder and softer       | Angular and sharp imagery            |
| Sounds are softer                     | Sounds are sharp and screamy         |
| Soldiers have a face                  | Faceless                             |
| Colours are coded as white and bright | Colours are coded as dark            |
| Emotion/care/life preservation        | Deadly and cold                      |
| Humanized                             | Still, faceless and en masse         |
| Organic and natural symbols           | Mechanical and technological symbols |

Jedi and Sith are one and the same, and can be bridged

Rebellion and Empire are binary opposites, and will always be at odds as per their fundamental nature.

#### *In media res* - Establishing Shot

Star destroyer looms over the viewer;
Starting in the middle of conflict;
Big battle shop $\rightarrow$ Arms race allegory



### Hero and Myth in American Film

`What vision does A New Hope offer?`

Luke has been on the ranch forEVER. His whole life he has been doing one thing.
Exemplified actively by Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, Luke longs for adventure, and he gets it. Luke longs for a greater purpose.

#### What is the Heroâ€™s Journey and its Relation to Myth and Literature?

Archetype - Reoccurring framework
- Denotes narrative designs, patterns of action, character types, themes, and images which recur in a wide variety of works of literature, as well as in myths, dreams, and even social rituals[^1]
[^1]: Abrams and Harpham 16

## Notes

### Jungian 

- [ ] Read!!!

**Depth psychology**: Patterns of experience since our very ancient ancestors which survive in the collective unconsciousness of the human

### Archetypes

[[#What is the Heroâ€™s Journey and its Relation to Myth and Literature?]]

**What did you notice in A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back**?
*Princess - Leia*
- Damsel in distress?
- Not really, she knows what she is doing and exactly how to do it.
- Stands up to Vader right away. Definitely not afraid

*Cowboy - Solo*


#### First Introduction of the Jedi - Ben Kenobi

Arthurian Merlin! 
Don't really know or understand what he represents.

### Why does Myth and Archetypal Criticism Matter?

Helps us identify some key differences, meaning behind things.

### Myth

Creation/Re-creation Myths
Coming of Age Myths
Sacred Marriage Quest
Father Quest
The Grail Quest

Star Wars features an interplay of several myths.

### What are *A New Hope* and *The Empire Strikes Back* Trying to Say?

**Leia**
Stereotypically feminine, but the story challenges this. 
Costuming does this a lot!
Actions too.

**Solo**
Does he know what he is doing?
- Scene Analysis - Han is leaving and Luke is upset.
	- Han can sometimes be an Anti-hero. Helpful but has his own agenda.
	- However, Luke is the Arthurian hero.
	- They are on different Hero paths, and they eventually cross over.

### Even More On Archetypes

**The Lone Ranger** - Han
- Indigenous partner
	- Power dynamic

### The Shadow

Vader is a warrior of the light fallen to evil, like the archangel.

### Politics

Star Wars presents "otherness" all the time. 

**Phenomenology**
The practice of awareness without prior assumptions.
We know the world through our bodies.

**Mind-Body Dualism**
Traced back to Plato
Also Rene Descartes
Non human animals are no more than machines that are made of flesh.
Jean-Paul Sartre $\rightarrow$ We are simultaneously being for self and of self.
*Yoda says we are more than our crude matter.*

## Notes

### Identity

#### Who gets to be the hero?

Often straight white males were portrayed as the American Hero.
Cultural shortcuts lead to otherness. 
Star Wars represents a lot about identity politics. 

### Mind-Body Dichotomy

Sartre - Understanding of our world is through our body. 

**McGann** critiques Yoda's assertion that "we are more than crude matter". 
- Yoda wanted Luke to think beyond his body, and that with and though his body, he can feel the luminous light throughout.
- Phenomenology - Yoda is actually saying that he doesn't want Luke to think of himself as a strong body, but rather one that is connected to the world.

The body is what the force connects to, it *is* the world. 
Does this challenge Mind-Body Dualism?

Morality is represented in film in visual form. 
- We learn about characters and learn about assumptions about those with certain bodies.

### Mise-en-Scene - Jabba

The Empire is cold, sharp, mechanical, sterile, metallic.
The Rebels are round, warm, lighter, brighter, natural, diverse.

**Discuss the Mise-en-Scene of Jabba's Palace**

| Jabba       | Bodies      |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Mobstery    | Many Shapes |
| Mucky       | Brute Power |
| Lawless     |             |
| No Humanity |             |
| Exotic      |             |
| Lavishing   |             |
| Owned       |             |

Some power structures can only exists if there *is* corruption.

### Episode I - The Phantom Menace

Presents a dystopic representation of the SW Universe. 
Planets are countries, another layer of galactic abstraction.

#### Lens Flare

- [ ] Read about lens flares in film and what they mean.

- [x] Check scene analysis outline Sep 29th or 30th. [completion:: Oct 17, 2023 @ 02:53 PM]

## Notes

**Reflections handed back next week.**

A New Hope was conceptualized during a dark moment in American history. Vietnam war, early 70s. The emperor is Nixon.
- Rise in Family Separation
	- More of a family oriented time, for sure.

Hard to consider SW as separate from Vietnam and WW2.

### Technology

The Technology of the Gungans is portrayed in a completely different way than the Separatists.
- Broader moral implications $\rightarrow$ Moral Imbalance
	- Separatists $\rightarrow$ Sheer numbers and more mechanical technology.
	- Gungans $\rightarrow$ Horseback, Catapults, Shields, Spears
	- German Invasion of Poland
		- Tanks vs. Horseback 

SW Written during a Sci-Fi Boom!
- Hollywood experienced a difficult decline, but Sci-Fi was booming.
- CGI was brand new, took over the scene.
- Green Screen for most every screen
- Used to depict the Jedi, Republic, as a prosperous moment in history.
	- Complex and Fast fight scenes.

1993 Bin Laden + WWW
1994 Rwandan Genocide

### Kurosawa

Bridge on the River Kwai comes first.

7 Samurai
Jimbo
Ikiru
Hidden Fortress

The visual goes a long way to telling the story and setting the mood.
Long Lenses - Isolate characters from background

#### **Hidden Fortress**

Story was told from the two lowest characters. Strongest Influence.

John Ford influenced Kurosawa. Western Japanese storytelling.

Why can't people be happier? Why can't people be happier together?

### Wetmore - The Tao of Star Wars
[[Tao in Star Wars]]

Wetmore, p. 96.

Taoism $\rightarrow$ Light and Dark must be balanced.
Western Religion $\rightarrow$ Darkness must be purged, the Light must prevail.

**The Dark Side is the Result of Taoism's being subjected to the Western concept of evil.**
- I severely agree with the concept behind the claim, but I don't know about the representation of the Dark Side *resulting* from this.
	- Being nitpicky of the words.
- The light and dark side could be western interpretations of the yin and yang. Cast shadow through a western filter
	- Eternal conflict, balance must be found so chaos will not prevail.

What is "balance" to the force?? Did they even think about it?

## Notes

### Orientalism

Arab Indian Islamic and East Asian
Lest Developed? Feminized. Mischievous, exoticized.

### The Phantom Menace

Anglo protagonists, and...
Viceroy $\rightarrow$ Eastern Asian Accent and Clothing

Thus, Lucas' films appropriated Orientalism to show who is good and bad.

**Non Human Characters $\rightarrow$ Comic Relief or Evil Beings**
- Jar Jar
- Chewbacca
- Nute Gunray
- Darth Maul

### Space Western

#### Han Solo - Space Cowboy!

- Independent
- Costuming
- Scoundrel
- Travelled Far in the "New Frontier"
- Bounty on his head

Boba Fett

Qui-Gon Jar-Jar ???????

### Mise-en-Scene

The sets, setting, costume, lighting, the acting, props, characters, and other people/objects in the scene.

The lighting is integral to the the MeS. It directs the viewers' attention, contributes to the mood, and creates atmosphere. COmment on the lighting frame-by-frame, and shot-by-shot.

#### The Shot

The single image produced between one **cut** to another **cut**. 

Why is it this? Why is it that?
Is it moving-frame, is it panning up or down? Where is the camera in relation to the subject?

#### Tone

Pay attention to the colours. Are they realistic, unrealistic? Black and white? Specific colour palette? Is there a lot of contrast? OR a lack of it?

#### Perspective

Is there an arch? (Internal framing)
Considers the space and its relationship to the people and the objects
