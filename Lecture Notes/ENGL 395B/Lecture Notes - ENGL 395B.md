### Binary Opposition and Dualism

Interrelated

Dualisms are ideologies or belief systems that are structured on binary opposites
- Mind-body
- Good-evil

*Works under the assumption that these ideas are always separate and opposite. Always B/W, no grey, etc.*

Our reading of binary oppositions using structuralism and deconstruction to highlight contradictions and variety within these structures, challenges, etc.

#### **Binary Opposition** in the Jedi and Sith

Possibly:
- **Represented by The Force**
	- 
- **Represented by The Ideology**
	- Two different Religions based on the single commonality of The Force

`Does Star Wars reaffirm or challenge dualistic thinking?`
On a movie by movie basis, it differs
- [[Episode IV - A New Hope|A New Hope]] $\rightarrow$ Mostly black and white, but it can in Obi Wan that he is previously affected.
- [[Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back|Empire Strikes Back]] $\rightarrow$ The idea that it can be bridged is introduced

As a whole in the universe, as the Force is a fundamental natural axiom, you cannot separate the belief systems into an explicitly binary opposition. Every movie is **framed** in a dualistic system, but then does some active defiance of that - maintaining that the dualism is still a greater reason for the conflict.

| The Rebellion                         | The Empire                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Ship imagery rounder and softer       | Angular and sharp imagery            |
| Sounds are softer                     | Sounds are sharp and screamy         |
| Soldiers have a face                  | Faceless                             |
| Colours are coded as white and bright | Colours are coded as dark            |
| Emotion/care/life preservation        | Deadly and cold                      |
| Humanized                             | Still, faceless and en masse         |
| Organic and natural symbols           | Mechanical and technological symbols |

Jedi and Sith are one and the same, and can be bridged

Rebellion and Empire are binary opposites, and will always be at odds as per their fundamental nature.

#### *In media res* - Establishing Shot

Star destroyer looms over the viewer;
Starting in the middle of conflict;
Big battle shop $\rightarrow$ Arms race allegory



### Hero and Myth in American Film

`What vision does A New Hope offer?`

Luke has been on the ranch forEVER. His whole life he has been doing one thing.
Exemplified actively by Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, Luke longs for adventure, and he gets it. Luke longs for a greater purpose.

#### What is the Hero’s Journey and its Relation to Myth and Literature?

Archetype - Reoccurring framework
