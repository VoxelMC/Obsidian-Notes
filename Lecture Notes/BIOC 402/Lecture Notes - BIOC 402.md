## Notes

**Absolute Configuration:** You must follow the order of things when determining the chirality.

Chirality does not determine D or L.

Amides are relatively stable, so it forces all of the R groups to do all of the interactions.

### General Properties of Amino Acids
- White crystalline solids
	- High melting and boiling temperatures due to:
	- Strong intermolecular forces.
- Amino acids are zwitterionic and amphoteric
	- Have both -ve and +ve charges
	- Highly soluble, forming electrolytes in solution.

### Isoelectric Point

AA with no protonatable R
- $pI = \frac{1}{2} (pK_{a_1} + pK_{a_2})$
AA with R that is neutral when protonated (Asp, Glu, Cys, and Tyr)
- pI is very low
AA with R that is positive when protonated (His, Arg, Lys)
- pI is very high

Glutamate is -1 at physiological pH.

Asp
+ +
+ 0
+ -1
+ -2
Lys
- +2
- +1
- 0
- -1

> The **isoelectric point** is THE *EQUIVALENCE* POINT at which the overall charge equals 0.
> -> There can be multiple equivalence points but ONLY ONE ISOELECTRIC POINT.

### Charge of Peptides

#### Isoelectric Point of a Dipeptide
1. Find all equivalence points
	1. Lower than lowest pKa has everything protonated (COOH and NH3+)
	2. Higher than highest pKa has everything deprotonated (COO- and NH2)
2. Figure out when the peptide is neutral
3. Take the average of the two surrounding pKa's 
4. Profit \$\$\$

## Notes

**SCOP2 Classification**
- All $\alpha$ 
- All $\beta$
	- $\beta$-propellor
- $\alpha$/$\beta$ --> interspersed
	- Rossman-fold
	- TIM barrel
- $\alpha$ + $\beta$ --> segregated

### Protein Domains

Each domain forms its OWN 3D structure.
It can evolve, function, and exist independently from the rest of the chain.

### Lecture Topic: Glycans

### Major classes of PMTs

50% of all proteins in nature, 80% cell surface or secreted
Glycosylation is one of the most important keys in understanding disease states

Affects protein localization, folding, stability, and solubility

### Structural diversity is crucial for glycan functions

#### Anomers

'alpha-Gal' is immunogenic -> red meat allergies
This originates from glycoproteins in red meat!

Galacto-oligosaccharide is in mom's milk. 

Alpha-Gal and galacto-oligosaccharide are only different by an alpha and beta linkage - respectively.

#### Linkage and branching

Adding an alpha-fucose in one place can control antibody effector responses, and in another place it will promote cell adhesion.
**Sialyl-Lewis<sup>x</sup>** -> immune recognition site

#### Regiochemistry

Enantiomers can be the difference between viral or human antigens

#### Glycosidic bonds

Needs an enzyme and a donor to occur. Usually a nucleotide sugar (UDP), is added to an acceptor (short chain glycan, monosaccharide, etc.)

```
Ser-square --GT1 + UDP-circle--> ser-square-circle (top-left) -----> subsequent transformation, so decreased in cancer.
 |
GT2 + CMP-diamon
 |
 v
Ser-square-diamond (top-right) --> ends here, increased in cancer
```

#### Forms of glycans

##### O-glycans
Transferred single sugar TO serine or threonine

> yellow square is n-acetylglucosamine

##### N-glycans

Transferred mature glycan TO Asn, Lys, etc.

Glycosylation occurs in the Endoplasmic Reticulum, built on the cytoplasmic side. Then, there is a flippase to invert it to the ER lumen.
- Starts with n-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), then stuff is added like mannose, glucose, mannose, then transferred to Asn residue in the 
  lumen.

### Is primary AA seq. sufficient to direct folding?

Anfinsen's dogma -> Levinthal's paradox

Not exactly. Chaperones are highly likely to exist, because we are not dead yet (Levinthal).
You can not always go back from denaturation.

**Calnexin and calreticulin; key chaperones in the glycoprotein folding cycle.**

###### Topic: **Finishing Folding**

## Notes

Term test - focus on second part of the course
Deadlines postponed for projects. Who cares, though...

### Finishing Foldings

Primary sequence is enough to dicate the final 3D structure of proteins. 
- Supported by Anfinsen's experiment.

### 4 Basic Folding Models

#### Heirarchal
1. Local secondary structures
	1. α-helices and β-sheets
2. 
#### Hydrophobic Collapse
- 

#### Nucleation propagation
- Local interactions form a small amount of native secondary and super-secondary structures which act a s a nucleus for more folding.
#### Nucleation-condensation
- Sufficient energy is required to form a metastable nucleus
- Once a sufficient number of stabilizing long-range interactions build up, the native structure condenses rapidly.

### Incremental Stepwise Folding

Small steady gains every time a correct iteration of folding completes. These are many intermediates at local minima

> Can you make a protein in many pieces, then denature with urea and mercapto-ethanol. then put them together in vitro, and then have them fold back?

**Calmodulin** - intrinsically disordered protein on binding.

### Enthalpy of Folding Interactions

#### Charge-charge Interactions

On the surface < 5 kJ/mol
Buried >15 kJ/mol 
Insignificant contributions

#### Disulphide Bonds

Strong covalent linkage, constraining, widely-spaced.
Broken at high temperatures, extreme pH's, and reducing environment.

**Example: Neuroglobulin**
- Native: 2 pairs of disulphide bonds.
- Mutate to introduce another disulphide bond, becomes stronger and more stable.
#### Van der Waals

Momentary dipoles.
Small magnitude, distance-dependent. Often the sum of small forces equalling a large force. 

#### Hydrogen Bonds

Stabilizes α-helices and β-sheets. 
< 10-40 kJ/mol, but with a large number.
Contributes overall stability of the protein.

#### Hydrophobic Interactions

*Most significant driving force behind folding and stability*
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS < 0

Burying a methylene group contributes to 4.6 kJ/mol to stability.
- Hydrophobic effect of released water, and
- enhanced Van der Waals interaction from tight interior packing.

Enthalpy is on the right (negative) and Entropy is on the left (positive) of ΔG.

### Misfolding and Folding Assistance

Chaperones keep proteins to going to irreversible problematic things like amyloid sheets (beta sheets aggregating and becoming too stable)
- Nucleation-propagation

Phenylalanine can mediate molecular interactions between peptide chains. This is because they are too big and provide steric hinderance at these beta sheets.

### PDB Data
Resolution in Å, smaller is better
R-value: real vs. computed diffraction patterns
- Perfect = 0
- Totally random = 0.63
- good is ~= 0.2
- could be biased
