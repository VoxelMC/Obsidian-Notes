## Notes

**Absolute Configuration:** You must follow the order of things when determining the chirality.

Chirality does not determine D or L.

Amides are relatively stable, so it forces all of the R groups to do all of the interactions.

### General Properties of Amino Acids
- White crystalline solids
	- High melting and boiling temperatures due to:
	- Strong intermolecular forces.
- Amino acids are zwitterionic and amphoteric
	- Have both -ve and +ve charges
	- Highly soluble, forming electrolytes in solution.

### Isoelectric Point

AA with no protonatable R
- $pI = \frac{1}{2} (pK_{a_1} + pK_{a_2})$
AA with R that is neutral when protonated (Asp, Glu, Cys, and Tyr)
- pI is very low
AA with R that is positive when protonated (His, Arg, Lys)
- pI is very high

Glutamate is -1 at physiological pH.

Asp
+ +
+ 0
+ -1
+ -2
Lys
- +2
- +1
- 0
- -1

> The **isoelectric point** is THE *EQUIVALENCE* POINT at which the overall charge equals 0.
> -> There can be multiple equivalence points but ONLY ONE ISOELECTRIC POINT.

### Charge of Peptides

#### Isoelectric Point of a Dipeptide
1. Find all equivalence points
	1. Lower than lowest pKa has everything protonated (COOH and NH3+)
	2. Higher than highest pKa has everything deprotonated (COO- and NH2)
2. Figure out when the peptide is neutral
3. Take the average of the two surrounding pKa's 
4. Profit \$\$\$

> **Gly-Asp**
> *+1*
> Gly-N -> 9.8
> *0* --> *Isoelectric Point*
> Asp-R -> 3.9
> *-1*
> Asp-C -> 2.0
> *-2*

### Stereochemistry of AAs

## Notes

**SCOP2 Classification**
- All $\alpha$ 
- All $\beta$
	- $\beta$-propellor
- $\alpha$/$\beta$ --> interspersed
	- Rossman-fold
	- TIM barrel
- $\alpha$ + $\beta$ --> segregated

### Protein Domains

Each domain forms its OWN 3D structure.
It can evolve, function, and exist independently from the rest of the chain.
