#### Part B

I believe that the family of lyases that are able to add water over a double bond are very important for synthesizing chiral molecules. Synthetic chemists could use this technique to activate a specific carbon, and by controlling the next reaction, the enzymatically established chiral centre could drive the reaction to a desired product.

## Question 2
#### a) Reaction Mechanism

Transglutamination occurs by crosslinking of a glutamine side chain to a lysine side chain at the terminal amide and amino groups - respectively. This occurs by the acyl transfer of glutamine to a cysteine residue in the transglutaminase, and then the subsequent removal of the amide NH2 & protonation by histamine to NH3. Then, the resultant thioester provides an ample leaving group for attack of the lysine to the ipso carbon. This produces a peptide bond, thereby fusing two proteins together.

#### b) Industrial Processes
**What industrial processes utilize transglutaminase?**


**Are there any other applications for its use?**
It is frequently used in "molecular gastronomy" to transform some food into another which has the same taste, but different texture. This is done due to the fact that cross-linking proteins in food can have many different effects on the structure of it, but the chemical composition remains the same, so it still tastes the same.

#### c) Is the enzyme used in a kinetically or equilibrium controlled process?

The enzyme is used in a kinetically controlled process because it forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate, as shown in
