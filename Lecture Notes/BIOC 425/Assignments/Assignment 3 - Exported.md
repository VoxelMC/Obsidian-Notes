1. Why is it important to discover new enzymes that can halogenate organic compounds? 

Halogenation of compounds such as natural products in nature is a basis of many important medicinal and industrial purposes. In classical synthetic organic chemistry, halogenation can require abnormal reaction conditions and yield abnormal results. Halogenated organic compounds are the basis of many medicinal and industrial molecules, as halogens work very well as leaving groups. Furthermore, halogens may also improve activity or stability of pharmaceutical compounds, such as fluorouracil and sofosbuvir - both clinical halonucleosides.

2. What are three known enzymatic mechanisms that lead to halogenation organic substrates?  

$\text{S}_{N}2$ nucleophilic substitution, typically by S-adenosyl methionine-dependent fluorinases.
Oxidation, by flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent halogenases.
Using an $Fe^{2+}$-α-ketoglutarate-dependent metalloenzymes, which use halogen radicals to perform the reaction.

3. What is the advantage of nonheme iron- and α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent halogenases compared to flavin-dependent halogenases or heme- or vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases.



4. What is the biocatalytic advantage of AdeV compared to other characterized nonheme iron- and α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent halogenases?  

AdeV is the first nonheme iron-α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenase to be able to selectively halogenate nucleotide-5'-phosphates. Considering that there are many pharmaceutical halonucleosides, this is an advantage to the organic synthesis that was previously required to create them.

5. What is the substrate for AdeV? Does it act early or late in the metabolic pathway?  

The substrate for AdeV is deoxyadenosine-5'-phosphate. The enzyme acts very late in the metabolic pathway described by Gao et al.

6. Why would it have been challenging to identify AdeV as a halogenase based on its amino acid sequence alone? What motif distinguishes it has a halogenase versus a hydroxylase?  



7. What would be a method that you would adopt to discover new nonheme iron and α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent halogenases?

The HXG/A motif would be a good sequence to look for when selecting candidates. Furthermore, presence of a β-hairpin motif in the enzyme indicates that it is likely a nonheme iron and α-ketoglutarate dependent halogenase. 

8. What strategy would you use to evolve AdeV to have a broader substrate selectivity? Provide a rationale for your choice.

I believe that iterative saturation mutagenesis of the active site residues can allow for broader substrate selectivity. To accomplish this, the amino acids which stabilize the transition state of the substrate should not be touched, but amino acids with smaller side-chains would be good substitutes for polar, aromatic, and aliphatic side groups. This would decrease specificity as the coordinating ability of these residues would reduce. As long as the active site is still able to bind most molecules after substitution, a broader spectrum of substrates may become accessible.
