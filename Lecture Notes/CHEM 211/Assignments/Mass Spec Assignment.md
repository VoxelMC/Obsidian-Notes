2. To provide a pass-through for conduction without compromising the vacuum seal required for the system to run. The sewing needles provide the electrical interface between the power source and the tungsten filament, and also between the copper cup detector and the pre-amplifier circuit.

3. The vacuum system is required to remove the chance that the ionized analyte will not collide with a gas molecule during its flight. Collision would render the instrument useless, as nothing would be detected!

4. The ion source is responsible for producing electrons with high enough energy to ionize your analyte. In a conventional, rich-man's mass spectrometer, this would be an electron beam! For this one, it was a tungsten wire with analyte deposited on it, to ensure that any high energy electrons emitted by the filament would be able to ionize a molecule.
