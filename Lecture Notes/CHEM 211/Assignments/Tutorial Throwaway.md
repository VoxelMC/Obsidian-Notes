### Methods

**Determination of Wavelength Max**
1. Appropriately Label Volumetric Flask 1.
2. Weigh 0.010 g of crystal purple merlot colorant.
3. Dissolve in 100 mL volumetric flask with deionized water.
4. Fill a cuvette 3/4 full with coloured solution.
5. Zero the spectrophotometer using a cuvette filled with deionized water.
6. Measure absorbance of stock solution at 520, 535, 550, 565, and 580 nm. 
**Determination of Purple Merlot Extinction Value**
1. Appropriately label a volumetric flask 2.
2. Weigh 0.200 g of crystal purple merlot and dissolve in citric acid buffer in a 100 mL volumetric flask to prepare a stock solution.
3. Transfer 20 mL of the stock solution to a new volumetric flask labelled "0.2 dilution" 
4. Transfer 10 mL of the stock solution to a new volumetric flask labelled "0.1 dilution"
5. Fill both volumetric flasks to the stop line with CAB to make the respective dilutions.
6. Cap and invert flasks
7. Zero spectrophotometer using citric acid buffer
8. Measure absorbance at $\lambda_{max}$  
**Determination of Unknown Concentrations**
