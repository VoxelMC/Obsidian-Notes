### Materials
- Spectrophotometer: Thermo Scientific Spectronic 200+
- 100 mL Volumetric Flasks: Pyrex
- 1 cm Cuvettes: Cole Parmer 
- Cuvette Holders: Unknown Brand
- Analytical Balance: Johns Scientific Inc. ER-120A
- Fisherbrand Pipetboy
- San Joaquin Valley Crystal Purple Merlot
- Citric Acid Buffer


### Methods
**Determination of Wavelength Max**
1. Appropriately Label Volumetric Flask 1.
2. Weigh 0.010 g of crystal purple merlot colorant.
3. Dissolve in 100 mL volumetric flask with deionized water.
4. Fill a cuvette 3/4 full with coloured solution.
5. Zero the spectrophotometer using a cuvette filled with deionized water.
6. Measure absorbance of stock solution at 520, 535, 550, 565, and 580 nm. 
**Determination of Purple Merlot Extinction Value**
1. Appropriately label a volumetric flask 2.
2. Weigh 0.200 g of crystal purple merlot and dissolve in citric acid buffer in a 100 mL volumetric flask to prepare a stock solution.
3. Transfer 20 mL of the stock solution to a new volumetric flask labelled "0.2 dilution"
