## Statistics Notes
#### Normal Distribution of data in a sample
- Values will cluster around the mean in a predictable distribution
	- Only with random errors
- Gaussian

#### Standard Deviation
- $\sigma$ is the true standard deviation of an infinite dataset
- Sample SD (s) is the closeness of the cluster in a limited dataset
- Variance is $s^{2}$
- %Relative SD (%RSD = $\frac{s}{mean} * 100$)
- $s = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma (x_{i} - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$ 
- Triplicate is the minimum
- Small tiny baby error bars are probably not all that good, usually.

#### Standard Error
$s_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ 
- Experiment with Error Bars

#### % Relative Standard Deviation
$\text{\% RSD} = \frac{s}{mean}\cdot 100$ 
- Smartie factory doesn't try to put the same number of colours or smarties in the box.
