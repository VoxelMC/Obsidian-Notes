A cDNA library is a bunch of bacteria that have each been transformed with a plasmid containing a piece of cDNA which was created from a total RNA extraction that was treated with reverse transcriptase. The plasmids are generated using a cloning method such as PCR adapting to the poly A tail. Then the mRNA-DNA hybrid is denatured and the mRNA is degraded with alkali. Then the 5' is prepared by ligating the 3' end of the to a known adapter, then DNA pol I and dNTPs are added to create the second strand. Then this is blunt end cloned into the vector!  


## Describe making a cDNA library from a petunia plant, from scratch.

**Floral tissue**
**Adapt and put into a bunch of bacteria**
**Clone ORF for Gene X**
**Make degenerate primers from the AA sequence**
**Make probes using ^**
**Use probes to find colonies using Southern Blot method**
**Grow colonies, extract plasmid, sequence the gene, express the cloned DNA in bacteria and produce protein.**
**Assay the protein**

1. Make a total RNA extraction from the organ of interest (flower). 
2. Use reverse transcriptase to create cDNA from the mRNA.
3. Use dNTPs, poly-A primers, and a known adapter to produce the complimentary strand to the cDNA, completing it.
4. Create a probe from the cDNA using degenerate primers.
	1. These degenerate primers are derived from the fragmentation and sequencing of amino acids from the target enzyme.
5. Clone these fragments into vectors, and transform bacteria with them.
6. Grow each bacteria on a large agar plate.
7. Transfer colonies to nitrocellulose film, and perform Southern Blot using probe made earlier.
8. Grow any positive colonies, 
9. Extract their plasmid DNA
10. Sequence the plasmid, if it is correct, transform some more bacteria and produce r-protein.
11. Harvest r-protein and assay it to test for correct mechanism.
