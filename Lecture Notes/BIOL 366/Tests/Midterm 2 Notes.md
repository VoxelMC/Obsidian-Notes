A cDNA library is a bunch of bacteria that have each been transformed with a plasmid containing a piece of cDNA which was created from a total RNA extraction that was treated with reverse transcriptase. The plasmids are generated using a cloning method such as PCR adapting to the poly A tail. Then the mRNA-DNA hybrid is denatured and the mRNA is degraded with alkali. Then the 5' is prepared by ligating the 3' end of the to a known adapter, then DNA pol I and dNTPs are added to create the second strand. Then this is blunt end cloned into the vector!
