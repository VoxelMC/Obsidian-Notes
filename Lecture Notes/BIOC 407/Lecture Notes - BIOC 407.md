## Notes

**Myotonic Dystrophy**

Myo - muscle
tonic - movement
dystrophy - regression

Autosomal Dominant

DM -> insulin insensitivity -> diabetes-like symptoms -> hypothyroidism

Congenital presentation

### Testing

Whatever is posted is testable until stated otherwise.

Don't test tables 1, 2 and 3, box 1, and sections:
- Marked heterogeneity
- Genetic polymorphisms
- liothyronine monotherapy
Or the Huntington's and myotonic dystrophy papers. 

LOs are just one of the focus of the test.

###### Topic: **PBL2 Naturopath Guest Lecture**

## Notes

### Naturopathy

**Tenets**
- The healing power of nature
	- Cuts "magically" heal
- Do no harm
- Find the cause
- Treat the whole person
- Preventative medicine

- 4-year post-grad course
- Preventative medicine
- Referrals when needed

**Advice**
- Clinical Nutrition

### Pain

**Nociceptive**
- Normal
**Neuropathic**
- Shingles?
**Psychogenic**

### Inflammation

> Vascular and cellular response to trauma

**Signs of Inflammation**
- Pain
- Head
- Redness
- Swelling
- Loss of Function

**Acute**
- Allergy
- Chemicals
- Infection
- Trauma injury
- Burns
- Lacerations, cuts, wounds
- Frostbite

**Chronic**
- Cardiovascular disease
- Neurological disease
- Autoimmune disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Cancer
- Lupus
- Fibromyalgia
- Chronic Fatigue Syndrom.

**Biochemistry**
- Arachidonic acid (COX) -> PG2 and PH2 -> Prostacyclin, thromboxane, PGD2, PGE2
- Arachidonic acid (LipoOXygenase) -> 5-HPETE -> Leukotrienes and Lipoxins

**Muscle Contraction**
- Calcium releases into the intracellular space, and binds to troponin, exposing myosin from tropomyosin

> Acetaminophen is not suitable for inflammation.

### Nutrients and Uses

- Top 10 probably

#### Calcium
- Bone, muscle, nerve
- Used in enzymatic reactions
- 99% in bones and teeth
- RDA is 800-1200 mg per day
- Need vitamin D for absorption
- Can relax muscles and nerves

#### Potassium
- Muscle, nerve
- Major electrolyte

## Notes

### Thinking About Individual Questions and Problems

1. Reflect on how you thought about what the question was asking
2. What process did you use to get to that answer?
3. What was your main reason to choose your answer, and same for not answers?

### Group Work

1. hare how you thought about what the question was asking
2. Share the process you used to answer it
3. What was the main reason for choosing or not choosing
4. How did your ideas compare to neighbours?
5. What was most confusing to you about the question?
6. How confident are you in you answer? Why? What do you need to know to increase the confidence?
