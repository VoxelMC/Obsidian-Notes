5. What is the difference between Alzheimer’s, dementia, and MCI?
	1. **Dementia:**
		- **Broad term:** Dementia is an umbrella term for a group of conditions characterized by a decline in cognitive function that interferes with daily life.
		- **Symptoms:** These can include memory problems, difficulty thinking and reasoning, impaired judgment, problems with language, and personality changes.
		- **Progression:** Dementia is progressive, meaning symptoms worsen over time.
		- **Causes:** Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, but there are other causes like vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia.
	2. **Alzheimer's Disease:**
		- **Specific type of dementia:** This is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases.
		- **Symptoms:** Similar to dementia in general, but with a characteristic pattern of memory loss being the earliest and most prominent symptom.
		- **Progression:** Alzheimer's is progressive, with symptoms gradually worsening over time. The rate of decline can vary.
		- **Cause:** The exact cause of Alzheimer's is not fully understood, but it's linked to the buildup of abnormal proteins in the brain, such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
	1. **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):**
		- **Early stage of cognitive decline:** MCI is considered a stage between normal age-related memory decline and dementia.
		- **Symptoms:** People with MCI experience greater memory problems than expected for their age, but these issues don't significantly interfere with daily activities.
		- **Progression:** MCI doesn't always progress to dementia. Some people with MCI stay stable, while others improve or develop dementia.
6. What specific brain regions are affected by long- vs short-term memory loss? 
	1. Long: Hippocampus, medial temporal love
	2. Short: Prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe
7. Is it true that you cannot diagnose Alzheimer’s while patients are alive?  
	1. Currently, a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can only be made through an autopsy, which examines the brain tissue after death. This is because the definitive signs of Alzheimer's are the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.
8. What case information is already available that helps determine the Alzheimer’s risk for this particular patient? (ex. Age, Apo-E, etc.)  
	1. Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
		1. However, they take drugs for hypotension
	2. A 20-pack-year history of smoking can contribute to vascular issues that might increase dementia risk.
	3. Nothing else.
9. Differentiate between the term cognitive vs neurological vs memory problems 
	1. **Cognitive**: Refers to difficulties with thinking skills such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, judgment, attention, and decision-making.
	2. **Neurological**: Issues that arise due to dysfunction in the brain, spinal cord, or nerves.
	3. **Memory**: Difficulties with encoding, storing, or retrieving information. *It is a specific type of cognitive issue.*
10. Are there familial Alzheimer’s cases? How common are they?  
	 - **Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD):** This is the term used for Alzheimer's caused by specific gene mutations passed down through families.
	- **Prevalence:** Estimates suggest FAD makes up **15-25%** of all Alzheimer's cases [1].
	- **Cause:** AD is linked to mutations in three main genes: Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) [2]. These mutations significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's at a younger age, often with symptoms appearing in a person's 40s or 50s (early-onset) compared to the more typical late-onset Alzheimer's after 65 [3].

11. Research all drugs and the terms mentioned in the case slides.
	1. **Ramipril:** This belongs to a class of medications called ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily and reducing the pressure on your arteries.
	2. **Hydrochlorothiazide:** This is a diuretic, also known as a "water pill." It helps your kidneys remove excess salt and water from your body, which reduces the amount of fluid circulating in your bloodstream and consequently lowers blood pressure.
