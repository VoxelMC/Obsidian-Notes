#### Paradigm Shifts

Loss of function in thyroid gland -> hypothyroidism
First treated with sheep thyroid extract in 1891
- Variable potency
- Too much T3 -> Thyrotoxic symptoms

"Thyroxine" - principal component of thyroid extract - T4

Sodium L-thyroxine is **levothyroxine**

T3 - also a thyroid hormone

Athyreotic: **an abnormal condition caused by absence or functional deficiency of the thyroid gland**.

T4 -> T3 by deiodination (not by the thyroid, because it happened in athyreotic patients.)

**Levothyroxine is generally better than sheep thyroid...**

> the thyroid gland secretes 20% of daily T3 production, whereas 80% is generated extrathyroidally by iodothyronine deiodinases.

> Hypothyroidism in the vast majority of patients is not transient but permanent in nature and requires lifelong medication.

> The frequency of having an additional autoimmune disorder is 9.67% in patients with Graves disease and 14.3% in those with Hashimoto thyroiditis.

> One study in patients on levothyroxine replacement showed that high free T4 and low TSH levels were associated with improved well-being (that is, decreased scores on general health questionnaires), whereas no such association was observed with free T3 levels; moreover, no correlation was seen between thyroid function test results and anxiety or depression.

> a greater change in serum free-T4 levels is required in hypothyroid patients to obtain the same effect on serum TSH

> The verdict is clear: levothyroxine monotherapy should remain the treatment of choice for hypothyroid patients, as stated in all current guidelines.

> **levothyroxine plus liothyronine combination therapy has not been proven to be superior to levothyroxine monotherapy, nor does combination therapy relieve persistent symptoms effectively.**

> *combination therapy might have benefits if levothyroxine:liothyronine dose ratios are applied that result in normal serum TSH levels and free T4:free T3 concentration ratios, or when given to patients who harbour specific genetic polymorphisms.*

> Commercially available levothyroxine plus liothyronine combination tablets are not recommended because their levothyroxine:liothyronine dose ratio is lower than 13:1

> A search for original articles published between 1960 and 2013 on the treatment of hypothyroidism was performed in MEDLINE and PubMed. The search terms used were “hypothyroidism”, “treatment”, “levothyroxine” and “liothyronine”. All articles identified were English-language, full-text papers. We also searched the reference lists of identified articles for further relevant papers.
