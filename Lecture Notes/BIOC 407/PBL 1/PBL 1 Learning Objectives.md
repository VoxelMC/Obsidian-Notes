1. **Does it make sense that T3 & T4 levels are low when TSH is elevated?**  
	1. Yes, because it is a feedback loop. It is not that T3 and T4 levels are low when TSH is elevated, it is that TSH is elevated BECAUSE T3 and T4 levels are low!
2. **What is the drug that was prescribed (Levothyroxine), how does it relate to T3,T4,TSH?**  
	1. Levothyroxine is the L isomer of T4
		1. Taking it should increase the levels of Thyroid hormone, thus decreasing the levels of TSH via a negative feedback loop.
3. **Is there such a clinical condition as congenital hypothyroidism?**  
	1. Yes.
4. **What is Hashimoto’s disease and can it be passed onto the baby from mother, father, sibling (another baby/person)?**
	1. Hashimoto's disease is the autoimmune recognition of the thyroid cells, causing hypothyroidism.
		1. Congenital transmission of the antibodies is possible, but short-lived. The baby needs to be treated with thyroid hormone!!!
5. **What are crystallins. Do they have a role in cataract?**  
	1. They are a class of proteins that are present in the eyes.
	2. Cataract is formed when open-ended domain-swapped dimers polymerize into aggregates. What causes that? sugar?
6. **What is the biochemical basis of CPK as a clinical test?**
	1. How is CPK measured in the clinical laboratory (biochemical or other method used
	2. are there individual tests for CPK 1, 2, & 3 and 
	3. is there a single general CPK test. 
	4. How are they interpreted?  
7. **Is the large size of the mother during pregnancy indicative of the large size of the baby?**  
	1. Something that is preventing normal cell growth in the mother is also affecting the baby.
8. **Vindicate:** 
	1. the mother,
	2. the baby, 
	3. the father  
9. **Do we know the baby’s gender? Is that information important?**  
	1. Yes, it is a boy. It could be a prevalence or sex dependance question.
10. **How are babies tested at birth? Is there a standardized test (e.g., APGAR)?**  
	1. APGAR
		1. 
11. **What was the mother’s age 5 years ago? Is it the same age as her father’s when he started showing symptoms? Could there be signs of an unknown disease escalating from generation to generation as it is being passed down?**
	1. She was 29 years old. Her father was 20ish years older when he started to show his first signs. 
	2. There are signs. Myotonic dystrophy is possible!
	3. Is Hashimoto's progressive?
