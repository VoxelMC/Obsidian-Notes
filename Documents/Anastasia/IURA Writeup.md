- During the summer's research
	- Was able to do extensive research on the discovery of novel chemicals produced by enzymes found in Indian Snakeroot
	- Able to learn that different enzymes required different conditions, and how to verify what these conditions are.
		- In fact, one of the enzymes had quite unique requirements which will be a topic of future research in Dr. Dang's lab.
	- By the end, I was able to find two enzymes which produced a total of 7 previously uncharacterized products
		- Compounds did not match any standards.
		- Why is this important? 
			- Likely to be bioactive
			- Similar to those already used in pharmaceutics

- Learned of academic rigours
	- Learned to work in a real-life lab environment
	- Crucial techniques for my future career in synthetic biology/molecular biology
- I will be continuing my research in Dr. Dang's lab with an honours thesis, applying the knowledge I gained from this award to enzymes from a plant new to the lab...?
