## Notes
- During the summer's research
	- Was able to do extensive research on the discovery of novel chemicals produced by enzymes found in Indian Snakeroot
	- Able to learn that different enzymes required different conditions, and how to verify what these conditions are.
		- In fact, one of the enzymes had quite unique requirements which will be a topic of future research in Dr. Dang's lab.
	- By the end, I was able to find two enzymes which produced a total of 7 previously uncharacterized products
		- Compounds did not match any standards.
		- Why is this important?
			- Likely to be bioactive
			- Similar to those already used in pharmaceutics

- Learned of academic rigours
	- Learned to work in a real-life lab environment
	- Crucial techniques for my future career in synthetic biology/molecular biology
- I will be continuing my research in Dr. Dang's lab with an honours thesis, applying the knowledge I gained from this award to enzymes from a plant new to the lab...?

## Writeup

My research this summer focused on the discovery of novel chemicals produced by enzymes found in Indian Snakeroot, or *R. serpentina*. I believe that this research is the beginning of discovery with significant implications in the scientific community.

I was given the opportunity to gain a deep understanding of the process of characterizing enzymes; especially finding optimal conditions. I have already made the interesting discovery of an enzyme with notably unique requirements, which my supervisor Dr. Dang is interested in investigating further.

By the end of the summer, my work culminated in an inquiry of two enzymes. I have identified that two of my 11 original alcohol dehydrogenases are efficient in production. I have also identified that these two enzymes synthesize a total of 7 potentially novel compounds, as they do not match any of our standards. To complete the lifespan of this project, the structures will be elucidated via NMR soon.

This discovery is significant because these novel compounds are likely to be monoterpene indole alkaloids, which are typically bioactive compounds. Therefore, these novel compounds may be potential pharmaceutically active compounds.  Supporting this, other compounds reported in the literature to be created by similar enzymes are currently used in the clinical field.

Aside from the findings, this research has taught me a lot about the rigours of laboratory research. Working in this real-life lab environment, I learned numerous techniques ranging in difficulty from fundamental to advanced. I predict that I will use these techniques well into my future career. This experience undoubtedly shaped me into a skilled researcher in the fields of synthetic biology and molecular biology.

Last, I am glad to continue my scientific exploration with Dr. Dang and her lab by pursuing an honours thesis. First, I will finish my summer research project, then I will apply the techniques that I have learned to a new species of plant.
