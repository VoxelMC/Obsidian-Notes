### 1. What is the most surprising thing that you learned from the 2 readings?

Professors actually have many opportunities to apply ChatGPT to many things.
Never looked at it from this perspective, it has always been about how students can cheat or how people can put their work off to a robot
Never look at it from another perspective.

How can we be protected from accusation?

### 2. What do you think are the “Pros” of Artificial Intelligence for Chemists?

- Chemistry is not entirely text-based
	- Good supplementary information for schematic-based learning, such is an organic chemistry lecture.
	- Easier to search for things and describe reactions
- Paper summary
	- Ease of access for academic material

### 3. What do you think are the “Cons” of Artificial Intelligence for Chemists?

- Still have to vet responses for untrue information.
	- Useful but not infallible.

### 4. How will Artificial Intelligence change your education?

I will be very conscious about my work
- In order to avoid false accusation
- Be prepared for such accusation

Once, I was deducted a mark on a lab report for reporting a mass of 1.000 grams, cited as "taken directly from the lab manual, it wasn't actually 1.000 grams", when I actually legitimately measured 1.000 grams on the analytical balance!!

### 5. How will Artificial Intelligence change your career?

Tedium can be handed off to the computer, which is for the best.
- Quality of my time will improve

The field will likely change and adapt, it will be provided at a level playing-field.


### 6. What do you want me to know about Artificial Intelligence?

AI can be used not just for scientific or educational purposes, but for fun and for art
